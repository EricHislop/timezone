  p What challenges did you encounter during the timestamp conversion? How did you resolve these?Â 

  p Some challenges I faced with the time stamps was figuring out how to get the correct time based on the given time zone.
    | I used a module which gave the timezone from the provided Longitude and Latitude.
    | I also found using a module I've used a lot in the past moment.js to be very helpful.

  p Were there any details where you had to make assumptions or decide to implement imperfectly?

  P I decided to implement the Extension 3 imperfectly, allowing you to enter two Longitudes and Latitudes 
    | and it sends back the distance between the two. I felt this was a task I could achieve in given the time frame.
  P I don't store the data so when the api is used it reads the csv every time.

  p If you were to redo this task, what improvements would you consider making?

  p I would look into using mongodb, I thought that it might have been simpler to setup than mysql which I used to create some 
    | tables using code. I ended up spending a lot of time on this and decided to start fresh.
    | I would also would have liked to make things look nicer using bootstrap.
